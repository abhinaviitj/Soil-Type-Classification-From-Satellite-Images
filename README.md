# Soil-Type-Classification-From-Satellite-Images
Nowadays, with the advancements in the fields of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), we have new ways for estimating soil types and its spatial distribution with reasonable costs and accuracy. The innovation of this work is to use LANDSAT satellite image data and GIS to assess land information and perform soil classification using deep neural networks.
